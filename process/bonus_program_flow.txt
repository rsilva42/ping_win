I hope the formatting of my .c files is intuitive, but to help here are the
ordering rules:
1. the functions are read from the bottom up
2. the sub functions appear directly above its parent
3. helper functions that don't contribute to the logic are at the top of
   the file
4. functions are in order of appearance in their parent

ex:

 D()----
       |
       |
--B()<--
| {
|   D
| }
--C()
|
-->A()
   {
     B
     C
   }

A calls B and C, so in call order B and C show up.
Since B calls D, D shows up directly above... this looked better in my head
maybe I am just sleep deprived =.=
