The first thing that I did after reading the problem statement was create a
plan of how the program would flow, I took the most intuitive steps: parse,
ping, print. From there I decided the input and output of each step; parser
takes in user input and outputs the information that ping needs if it does not
exit on input error, ping takes in the parser's token and outputs information of
the each packet along with the total packet info at the end, print uses the raw
info and transforms it to human readable output sent to the command line. Once
I had the high level logic down I wrote the pseudo code for each major function
to make sure I can take clean logical steps to get to the desired output. Here
is where certain sections started to flesh out like ping's three main steps of
connect, send, listen. Here I actually ran into a problem with how to manage
the exiting of the loop, because the interrupt signal can come at any time, I
took some time trying to find a way to pass a parameter to a signal handler
